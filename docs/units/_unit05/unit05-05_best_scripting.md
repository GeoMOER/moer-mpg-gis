title: "Control files and functions"

At the moment there don't seem to be any real advantages to using functions instead of control scripts.  The main reason is that we just created a batch file that simply processes external functions (e.g. those of the lidR package) one after the other.
<!--more-->
However, we also notice that we still have to do a lot of preprocessing and already the control files are starting to get cluttered. 
Therefore it makes sense to separate and generalize some repetitive functionalities.  For example, the preprocessing of the lidar data up to the correct setup of the catalog. 

Keep in mind we should go one step further and [follow Hadley Wickham's explanation](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#when-should-you-write-a-function) when you should write a function?  

## Splitting up the control file
However we start simply with splitting up the control files to clarify the structure and reduce the redundant repetitions.

It is a good practice to separate at least setup of a projet, data pre-processing, data analysis and the presentation of the results. 
{: .notice--success}

This separation means that we need a kind of a master control script that rules the workflow and provides general settings. 

We start bottom up. First we transform the clipping into a function.


### Seperating the clipping of an arbitrary Area of Interest from LAS data

So if I want to extract a section from a LAS file it would be very helpful to be able to call this as a function. In this call at least the data file and the coordinates have to be passed.

Furthermore it is mandatory for further projects to have a detailed or standardized documentation. This costs once more time but pays off more than.  Please note that the following examples already use the `Roxygen2` documentation syntax which can be used later for automated documentation 

Let us start with the `10_CHM_Catalog.R` control script. This script already uses a setup script (`000_setup.R`) to create a reproducible environment. So we have to identify four different aspects:

* what is code that is used again and again? -> make a function of it
* what is the general setup for my working environment? -> put it into the setup script
* what are the overall control structures (workflow, settings etc.)-> create a master control file for ruling the rest

# Type: control script 
# Name: 10_CHM_Catalog.R
# Author: Chris Reudenbach, creuden@gmail.com
# Description:  script creates a canopy height model from generic Lidar 
#              las data using the lidR package. In addition the script cuts the area to 
#              a defined extent using the lidR catalog concept.
#              Furthermore the data is tiled into a handy format even for poor memory 
#              and a canopy height model is calculated
# Data: regular las LiDAR data sets 
# Output: Canopy heightmodel RDS file of the resulting catalog

### Adaption of 000_setup.R

To utilize this conept we need to adapt the `000_setup.R` script. Basically we have add the argument `fkts` which is pointing to a folder which contains all of our functions - in this case the `cut_mof()` function. Addtionally we have moved some of the common variables and options in the basic setup file. 

```r
#---- mpg course basic setup

#devtools::install_github("gisma/uavRst")
devtools::install_github("r-spatial/link2GI")

mvSpec<-mapviewTopoColors<-mapview::mapviewPalette("mapviewSpectralColors")
