## Learning objectives
At the end of your project you should be able to
* compute arbitrary indices using R packages like lidR 
* discuss and identify the central aspects of this indices according to ecological and forest management related questions,
* assess the overall quality using eyeball and a numerical accuracy assessment method,
* work efficiently in teams on short-term projects and use collaborative project and software development tools,
* efficiently document your code and analysis workflow for re-usability and scientific review,
* integrate your work with the GI project 1 in a paper.


## Standing on the shoulders of giants and your own feet
You already have collected experience in scientific knowledge generation, team work, and the transparent presentation of results.  And do not follow the documentation example below. Build upon it when working on your next project assignment.
