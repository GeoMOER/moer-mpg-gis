title: "Ungraded Assignment GI-Project"
---

Development, design and implementation of a tree segmentation that allows the calculation of horizontal and vertical structural and competitive indices based on LiDAR data.

<!--more-->



At the end of your ungraded assignment project you should be able to
* Develop, design and implement medium complex GI workflows
* adequately and sufficiently document your code and analysis workflow for re-usability and scientific review,
* process optical and LiDAR data to compile a useful and adequate dataset for your area of interest
* discuss and collaborate with colleagues  project collaborative software development tools
* compute arbitrary indices using R packages like `lidR`
* discuss and identify the central aspects of the results in the context of a self-chosen ecological and forest management related research question
* assess the overall quality using eyeball and a numerical accuracy assessment method
* communicate your work in a preliminary online paper.


To get an idea on tree delineation concepts in general, the Master thesis of [MÃ¶ller Finn](https://ilias.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=file_1795800_download&client_id=UNIMR){:target="_blank"} on comparing different segmentation algorithms can be a starting point.

## Task of the GI project
Please calculate based on the provided LiDAR data and covering the MOF the following products:

* digital elevation model (DEM)
* digital surface model (DSM)
* canopy height model (CHM)
* crucial horizontal and vertical competition and structure parameters


Please compile a comprehensive data set and a short (one slide) report of this project as well as operational scripts on github four weeks before the end of the course.
