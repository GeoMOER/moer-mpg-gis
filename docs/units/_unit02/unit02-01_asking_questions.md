Asking questions and finding answers is the basis of scientific work. This includes an extensive repertoire of procedures and techniques.  With regard to geoinformation science, it is of central importance to be able to abstract the real world in a comprehensible way, to depict it in corresponding data models and to derive reliable information from it.

## Things you need 

### Further Reading 

* [Critical Reading](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/critical-reading)
* [How to write a Research Question](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/how-to-write-a-research-question)
* [Example Worflow scientific Work](https://libraries.indiana.edu/sites/default/files/Develop_a_Research_Question.pdf)

### Data set for training purposes

* [Download](http://gofile.me/3Z8AJ/c6m5CfvWZ){:target="_blank"} data from the working group data server.

### Getting familiar with the Shell

Shell — any command line environment will do for most of the exercises. For Linux we recommend the [bash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29) shell. For Windows, although the Windows command line can be used, we strongly recommend the shell coming with the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w) installation. If you want a Linux flavored shell in Windows, you can also use the one that comes with the [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) installation which you would need for Git anyway.

### Getting familiar with GIS Software
GIS — most commercial or open source GIS systems will be fine. Actually in the beginning we strongly recommend:

* [QGIS](HTTP://www.qgis.org/de/docs/user_manual/index.html#qgis-manual-index-reference) has become one of the most promising and most integrative open source GIS systems over the last years. Through the processing plugin, it additionally integrates modules from the other leading free GIS solutions like [GRASS](http://grass.osgeo.org/documentation/), [SAGA](http://www.saga-gis.org/en/about/references.html)and the [Orfeo Toolbox](http://orfeo-toolbox.org/otb/) which is specifically designed for remote sensing operations. Regarding installation, for Ubuntu Linux, the [Ubuntu GIS package](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuGIS) is a good choice. For Windows, we strongly recommend installing everything via the [OSGeo4W](http://trac.osgeo.org/osgeo4w/) environment and not individually.


## Things to take home from this session
At the end of this session you should be able to:

* deconstruct an idea to derive definitions and a preliminary workflow
* identify data sets and it capabilities to provide you with informations
* have an rough idea about softwaretools that may be helpful
