One could claim that the fact living on the surface of the earth and only get to know a small space through direct personal experience is the most important motivation for most of the geographic work. Compensation for this lack of direct experience has been and is being made, especially in scientific geography, with the help of efficient spatio-temporal techniques of abstraction. However, over the past few decades, traditional communication techniques as maps and descriptions have initially been supplemented by a variety of media communication tools of spatial information and, more recently, increasingly replaced.

Nevertheless, in relation to the complexity of the world and the enormous dynamics of its change, despite all scientific efforts, we know only insufficiently about the spatial-temporal events of the present. Much less do we know about the past and basically nothing about the future of the world.
Irrespective of this, knowledge of spatial and/or temporal aspects of our environment is increasingly in demand for action-relevant relationships. Whether we ask as tourists, consumers, producers or planners spatial information, or even knowledge. As such actors, we need in almost all social and economic issues not only detailed and reliable information, but also knowledge and knowledge about unknown space-time relationships and processes and - also with rising tendency - also about expected future developments. But also individually, due to our high mobility, globalized connections and mobile communication technologies, a rapidly growing number of people demand a comprehensive spatiotemporal knowledge.

Geographic information systems (GIS) are versatile and powerful software tools that are used in modeling, analysis, data mining merging and numerous other spatio-temporal applications. Nevertheless the most powerful tool is our mind developing the concepts and developing the necessary algorithms.

# Intended learning outcomes
At the end of this course you should be able

* to understand adapt and develop geographic information science methods and design workflows suitable to solve common spatio temporal data-related issues,
* to deploy your workflows using geo-information science tools, R scripts and collaborative code management platforms for task management and issue tracking, 
* to critically evaluate your spatiao-temporal analysis,
* to document and communicate your workflow and analysis results,
* to reflect your project workflow for potential improvements.



# Course features

The course is linked to the research of the Nature 4.0 project, heavily integrated into the parallel [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_327&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} and build upon the parallel [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_326&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} courses. It is intended as a blended learning module in our study program although the provided introductions, explanations and examples might be useful for self-study, too.

# Deliverables

The graded course certificate will be based on a team portfolio hosted as a team repository on GitHub. The individual portfolio items are defined in the respective course assignments along with the information if they will be marked or not. Marked portfolio items encompass the presentation and peer-review of two posters which inform about the results of two problem solving assignments related to the computation and analysis of the geographic information systems products.


# Preparation and prerequisites

The courses assumes basic knowledge and skills in remote sensing and GIS. Required R and GIS skills can be developed by the parallel courses [Data Analysis](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_326&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"} and [Geo Information Systems](https://oer.uni-marburg.de/goto.php?target=crs_327&client_id=mriliasmooc){:target="_blank"}.
